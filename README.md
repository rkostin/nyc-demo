# Readme for New York City Website

This is a six page website about New York City.  

## Ontology

The content about New York City is divided into five sections, one for each borough, and then some general information about the the city itself on the homepage.

**The goal of the website** is to inform website visitors about the city by providing facts about each borough.

**Domain:** New York City statistical information and interesting facts

### Classes (triples)

- Each city...
  - has a name (text)
  - has a city seal (image)
  - has an introduction (text)
  - has an "about" description (text)
  - has a history (text)
  - has population and land area statistics about each borough (data table)
- Each borough...
  - has a name (text)
  - has a representative photo (image 300 x 225px)
  - has geography information (text)
  - has characteristic information (text)

## Taxonomy

A city the size of New York as geographic areas known as **boroughs**.  

Each borough relates to facts about **geography** and **characteristics**, along with a **skyline** image that typifies what people usually think of in relation to that borough.  

The home page, about the overall city itself, presents a lot of statistics and points of interest in terms of its current size and population, as well as some of the city's history.

The prose of the website is factual and concise.  

- city
  - borough
    - skyline
    - geography
    - characteristics

## Choreography

Since the overall content of the New York City website is factual information, the order is primary focused on broad topics first, followed by more and more specific information.

Wurman: hierarchy --> broad to narrow scope

1. The user is introduced to a city first
   1. most general information: name, seal, and introductory content (Introduction, About)
   2. followed by the history of the city (History)
   3. followed by statistics, broken down by borough, which is a good lead-in to the subpages (Population)
2. The user is presented each borough of the city, ordered by population (navigation)
3. The user is introduced to each borough
   1. borough name and representative photo
   2. geography
   3. characteristics

## Layout

The title, website menu, and footer are inconsequential and simply need to be out of the way, in typical Z-pattern positions as appropriate.  

- Title: primary optical area
- Website menu: horizontal - from near-primary area, stretching to strong follow area
- Footer: terminal area

Except for the homepage, each subpage has three sections:

- the photo (most interesting/eye-catching)
- Geography (interesting)
- Characteristics (least interesting, borders on too-much information)

Recommended for subpages: F-pattern, with the image on the left, followed by Geography, and then the least interesting section: Characteristics.

The content on the homepage can follow the same layout except the table at the bottom is a forth section which can sit alone, out of alignment with the other sections.

## Mood of the Website

This website presents serious, straightforward information about New York City.  The content as well as the subject matter can be described as humor-less and precise.  Although some people think of New York City as a loud, vibrant place, this website does *not* present that aesthetic.  

Color combinations should be subdued, rather dull.  

Embellishments - especially lines (borders) can reflect the deco style that is widely used in a lot of the architecture of NYC.  Google Images: "deco architecture"

### Typography

Since the content delves into a lot of historical facts about the City, you can let that inform font choices.  Google Images: "New Yorker" to see the look and style of the New Yorker magazine.  You can't get that font for free, but you can find one that is reminiscent of it(...this is just a suggestion).  In any case, typefaces should use serifs for either headings or regular text, if not both.
